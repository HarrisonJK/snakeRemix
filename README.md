#This is my basic rundown of my snake game.

I remember playing snake on my dad's indestructible nokia phone when I was little and it was one of my first introductions to software as a child.

I thought it was fitting that I would then reiterate on that memory as I've become more and more familiar with computer programming.

I hope you like it.

I love you Dad! (though it is unlikely that you'll ever have a GitHub to read this)
